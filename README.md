# Protected-Modifier-and-Exception-Handling

##Explain the protected access modifier in Java. In which scenarios is it most useful, and how does it differ from private and public modifiers?
The protected access modifier in Java allows a member (fields or methods) of a class to be accessible in the same package and also in subclasses, even if they are in different packages. It strikes a balance between package-private (default) access and public access, allowing controlled visibility.  

Differences from Other Modifiers  
Private: Accessible only within the same class. It provides the most restricted access.  
Public: Accessible from anywhere in the application, offering the least restricted access.  
Protected: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses, even if they are outside the package.
